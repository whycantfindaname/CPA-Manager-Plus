# Configuration And Data Directory

CPAMP stores its core data locally. During deployment, identify three things first: where SQLite lives, how `data.key` is stored, and where the admin key comes from.

## Key Files

| File               | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `usage.sqlite`     | SQLite database for request events, configuration, prices, aliases, and related data. |
| `usage.sqlite-wal` | SQLite WAL file. Back it up when present.                                             |
| `usage.sqlite-shm` | SQLite SHM file. Back it up when present.                                             |
| `data.key`         | Data key used to encrypt sensitive configuration written to SQLite.                   |

Docker defaults:

```text
/data/usage.sqlite
/data/data.key
```

Native package defaults:

```text
./data/usage.sqlite
./data/data.key
```

## Admin Key

Full Docker and native Manager Server modes use a `cpamp_...` admin key for login.

Configure it with:

| Variable                     | Description                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `CPA_MANAGER_ADMIN_KEY`      | Pass the admin key directly.    |
| `CPA_MANAGER_ADMIN_KEY_FILE` | Read the admin key from a file. |

If it is not configured, the first startup generates a random admin key and prints it to the logs. It will not be shown again.

## CPA Management Key

CPAMP uses the CPA Management Key to access the CPA management API.

Where it is stored depends on the configuration source:

- CPA connections saved through setup or the panel are encrypted with `data.key` and written to SQLite.
- The one-click installer accepts `CPA_UPSTREAM_URL` and `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY` / `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY_FILE` as one-time import inputs. After a successful import, it encrypts the connection into SQLite with `data.key` and removes the temporary `secrets/cpa-management-key`. Manual deployments may still use these environment variables as a compatibility runtime mode, but that is not the installer's final state.

The configuration API returns only the `managementKeyConfigured` status; it never returns a reversibly decrypted CPA Management Key. Manager Server decrypts the key only when proxying requests, so the browser and third-party iframes do not need to receive it.

Connection records follow these authority rules: a complete `manager_config_v1` is authoritative and canonicalizes a stale legacy `setup` mirror; a complete compatible setup can complete a partial manager row. When no complete authority exists and partial records conflict, the server refuses to guess and requires an explicit `store-cpa-connection --repair-conflict` repair.

The CPAMP Lightweight Panel is hosted by CPA and continues to follow CPA-port access semantics; its browser-held key path is separate from Manager Server's server-side storage.

## Collection Configuration

Recommended setting:

```text
USAGE_COLLECTOR_MODE=auto
```

Auto mode tries RESP Pub/Sub, HTTP queue, and RESP pop in order.

Constraints:

- RESP connections must connect directly to the CPA API port, usually `8317`.
- HTTP queue can go through an HTTP proxy.
- `pollIntervalMs` should not exceed the CPA usage queue retention.
- CPA retention defaults to 60s and is capped at 3600s.
- Only one Manager Server should consume the same CPA queue.
